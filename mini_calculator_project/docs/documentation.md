# Documentation

## Project Overview
This mini project implements a simple console-based calculator in Python. The goal is to demonstrate the practical usage of development tools like Visual Studio Code, Git for version control, and GitHub for repository hosting and collaboration.

## Development Process
1. Created the project folder and opened it in VS Code.
2. Implemented arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) in `calculator.py`.
3. Added a main loop to allow repeated calculations and graceful exit.
4. Handled common errors like division by zero and invalid numeric input.
5. Created README.md and added screenshots to `assets/`.
6. Prepared `.gitignore` to exclude virtual environments and editor settings.
7. Suggested a Git workflow with at least 5 meaningful commits.

## Files & Structure
- `calculator.py` — main Python script
- `README.md` — project description and usage
- `.gitignore` — files to ignore in Git
- `assets/` — contains screenshots used in README
- `docs/documentation.md` — this file

## Future Improvements
- Create a GUI using Tkinter or PySimpleGUI.
- Add unit tests (pytest) and continuous integration (GitHub Actions).
- Add more functions (square root, power, trigonometry).
- Implement localization and input sanitization for different locales.
- Add logging and exception tracking.

## Collaboration (Bonus)
To collaborate:
- Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/gui`
- Push branch to GitHub: `git push -u origin feature/gui`
- Open a Pull Request on GitHub, request reviews, address comments, then merge.
